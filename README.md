We're building an image recognition system for billiards tables using Java and the J4K library. The inevitable goal of this project is to apply automated scorekeeping and player data tabulation and visualization during and between gameplay while adhering to the rules and rules variations between various billiards game types, both for tournament and casual play. And stuff. Below is a list of the tasks being worked on.

- [x] error logging system
- [x] starting screen
- [x] core gamekeeping screen
- [ ] player stat representations
- [x] button images
- [ ] kinect integration
- [ ] full rules handling
- [ ] data storage backend
- [ ] player login
- [ ] apple juice
- [ ] take pictures for the md file
